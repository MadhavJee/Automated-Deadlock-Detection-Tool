# Automated-Deadlock-Detection-Tool
Working Model
1. Project Overview
The Automated Deadlock Detection Tool is designed to identify and resolve deadlocks in systems where processes compete for resources. Deadlocks occur when processes are stuck in a circular wait, leading to system inefficiency and potential crashes. This tool automates the detection of deadlocks by analyzing resource allocation graphs (RAGs) or system logs and provides visualizations and resolution suggestions.

Goals:
Detect deadlocks in a system by analyzing process-resource relationships.

Visualize the resource allocation graph to help users understand the deadlock scenario.

Suggest resolution strategies, such as resource preemption or process termination.

Expected Outcomes:
A tool that can analyze system logs or runtime data to detect deadlocks.

Visual representation of resource allocation and process dependencies.

Recommendations to resolve or prevent deadlocks.

Scope:
The tool focuses on detecting deadlocks in systems where processes compete for resources.

It is applicable to educational, testing, or small-scale systems.
